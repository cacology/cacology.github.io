** Ascher, James P. "Visualizing Paper Evidence Using Digital Reproductions" /Scholars' Lab Blog/ (2017) http://scholarslab.org/digital-humanities/visualizing-paper-evidence-using-digital-reproductions/
   Examines how modern digitization techniques can expose otherwise
   invisible evidence in books, particularly 16-bit channel images and
   paper evidence.
** Ascher, James P. "The Wordes Moote be Cosyn to the Dede: Diplomatic Transcription and Shifting Senses of Exactness Toward the Ecosystem of Digital Reproduction," /Appositions: Studies in Renaissance / Early Modern Literature & Culture/ 8 (2011) [[http://appositions.blogspot.com/2011/05/james-p-ascher-diplomatic-e.html]]
   Some ways in which the expectations for an “exact” transcription of
   a document have changed over time, focusing on the oft-reprinted
   work of Chaucer.

   A meditation on the spacebar as object of both experience and in a
   historical moment; it demonstrates how the print historical can
   influence the everyday.

   ScriptaLab aimed to find the intersection of traditional
   book-oriented bibliographical studies and media studies; it
   included a lecture series, advanced faculty seminar, and
   publication series. The videos remain on YouTube, perhaps forever?

   private diary where you can keep your gossipy gossip and salacious
   life in the world's best editor.
** [[https://github.com/cacology/cacology.github.io]["Annotated checklist of Things by or About,"]] GitHub page, update 2016.
   You're looking at it, but it’s based on an org-mode file compiled
   with pandoc and styled with bare CSS. All hand-coded, all the
   time.

* Public Ethics
